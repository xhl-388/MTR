# My Tiny Renderer


## Brief Introduction
:smile:
This is a project based on (or mostly same with ) [ssloy:tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer).

I develop the project by my own , but provide the same interface as ssloy's project

It is a tiny renderer,which renders object in old way - rasterization.
